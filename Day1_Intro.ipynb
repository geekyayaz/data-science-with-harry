    "### Why Python for Data Science?\n",
    "- **Simple Syntax**: Python is easy to read and write, making it perfect for beginners.\n",
    "- **Libraries**: Python has powerful libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn** that make data manipulation and visualization easy.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Conda** is a powerful package manager that helps you manage your Python environments and dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Conda?\n",
    "- It isolates environments for different projects.\n",
    "- Manages package versions to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "- Works cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "- Easily integrates with data science tools like **Jupyter**.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, you are in the **base environment**. But for better control, you can create separate environments for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Check Available Environments\n",
    "\n",

    "To switch to the new environment, use:\n",
    "```conda activate myenv```\n",
    "### 5.Install Packages\n",
    "To install packages in the environment, use:\n",
    "```conda install -c conda-forge numpy```\n",
